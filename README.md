# Python-Library_Scikit_Learn
Basics of Scikit Learn:

•	It Provides simple and efficient tools for pre-processing and predictive modelling.

•	If we found any missing values within the dataset, we will impute those missing values using the scikit-learn Imputer.

•	For imputing the missing values, we will use Simple Imputer.

•	First, we will create an object of the imputer and define the strategy.

Steps to build a model in scikit-learn:

•	Import the model

•	Prepare the data set

•	Separate the independent and target variables

•	Create an object of the model

•	Fit the model with the data

•	Use the model to predict target
